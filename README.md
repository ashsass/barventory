# barventory
An app that allows bar's to track their inventory and alert employees when something is low or back in stock

## vision for the project
* I see this as an app that will make it incredibly easy for bartenders to know what their inventory looks like for the night before they start their shift
    * Should be able to make it dynamic for bar to bar. I'm going to make it specific to my bar and the greater vision is to make it as accessible as possible
    * For my bar in particular I want to be able to know if I have enough bottles of a product upstairs or if we will need to go to the downstairs stock
    * Additionally, I want to be able to know when something has come back in stock so that the entire team, not just the inventory receiver is on the same page about item availability
    * Give staff an alert with stock updates

* I eventually also want to add a place for recipes to be uploaded and kept in a very easy to use space for when a bartender needs to reference a recipe
    * This can include a space for classic cocktail recipes and allow multiple source material
    * This will be connected to the bar's inventory and therefore will notify a staff member if a recipe can be made or not depending on if you have the  item

* This can also include a section for prep and creating a system to manage how much prep needs to be done for the week depending on the company's pmix

## brainstorm to do
* In general, I need to come up with a style design. At this point I really don't know how I want the app to look

* Create the foundation for inputing inventory for the bar 
    * A page for inputing that bar's inventory
    * Maybe pull from an API if there is one for alcohol
    * Then upload the information to the page that the bartenders use to display what the stock is and how many bottles are upstairs and how many total are in inventory
